DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECT IN JAVASCRIPT

* The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

* You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object.

* The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods.

* Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior._
